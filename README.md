# schemaspy-snap

This repository contains a Snap package configuration of [schemaspy](https://github.com/schemaspy/schemaspy/).
I made this to avoid JDK / JRE version conflicts and having to mess around with JDBC driver locations.

## Known issues

- Only Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, Microsoft SQL Server (jTDS) supported for now (supporting more is a matter of adding more JDBC drivers in the package).
